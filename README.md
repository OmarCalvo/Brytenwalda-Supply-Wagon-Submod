# Brytenwalda-Supply-Wagon-Submod
A submod of the Brytenwalda Mount and Blade Warband Mod that reworks the Supply Wagon 


This is a comprehensive rework of the Supply Wagon feature of Brytenwalda. Fixes some bugs, adds a new interface, and rebalances the Wagon so that is neither overpowered nor useless. Adds a new feature, "Hide Wagon". 

The code files have the extension ".py", the compiled files ".txt". To use the submod, download the txt files and copy them in the Brytenwalda folder, overwriting the corresponding files. IMPORTANT: remember to backup your old files before copying! 

This submod was developed for Brytenwalda 1.41 "pure", with no extra additions or submods.
