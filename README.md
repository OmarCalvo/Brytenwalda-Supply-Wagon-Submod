# Brytenwalda-Supply-Wagon-Submod
A submod of the Brytenwalda Mount and Blade Warband Mod that reworks the Supply Wagon 


This is a comprehensive rework of the Supply Wagon feature of Brytenwalda. Fixes some bugs, adds a new interface, and rebalances the Wagon so that is neither overpowered nor useless. Adds a new feature, "Hide Wagon". 

The code files have the extension "py". They need to be compiled to "txt" files to be useful. The Warband modding subforum has detailed info on how to do this. As always, remember to backup your old files before copying! The code is offered as it is, and I'm not responsible for any loss or damages incurred in using this mod.


This submod was developed for Brytenwalda 1.41 "pure", with no extra additions or submods.
